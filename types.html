<p style="font-family:Lucida Bright;font-size:20px">Pong, the electronic table-tennis simulation game, was the first video game for many people who grew up in the 1970s and is now a famous symbol of early video games. However, the precursors to modern video games were created as early as the 1950s.</p>



<h2  style="font-family:Lucida Bright;color:#FF4500">Mobile Games</h2>
<center><img src="D:\images\im\d3.jpg" alt="video games" width=70%></center>
<p style="font-family:Lucida Bright;font-size:20px">A mobile game is a video game played on a feature phone, smartphone/tablet, smartwatch, PDA, portable media player or graphing calculator.The earliest known game on a mobile phone was a Tetris variant on the Hagenuk MT-2000 device from 1994.<br>In 1997, Nokia launched the very successful Snake.Snake (and its variants), that was preinstalled in most mobile devices manufactured by Nokia, has since become one of the most played video games and is found on more than 350 million devices worldwide. A variant of the Snake game for the Nokia 6110, using the infrared port, was also the first two-player game for mobile phones.Today, mobile games are usually downloaded from app stores as well as from mobile operator's portals, but in some cases are also preloaded in the handheld devices by the OEM or by the mobile operator when purchased, via infrared connection, Bluetooth, memory card or side loaded onto the handset with a cable.</p>
<p style="font-family:Lucida Bright;font-size:20px">Downloadable mobile games were first commercialised in Japan circa the launch of NTT DoCoMo's I-mode platform in 1999, and by the early 2000s were available through a variety of platforms throughout Asia, Europe, North America and ultimately most territories where modern carrier networks and handsets were available by the mid-2000s. However, mobile games distributed by mobile operators and third party portals (channels initially developed to monetise downloadable ringtones, wallpapers and other small pieces of content using premium SMS or direct carrier charges as a billing mechanism) remained a marginal form of gaming until Apple's iOS App Store was launched in 2008. As the first mobile content marketplace operated directly by a mobile platform holder, the App Store significantly changed the consumer behaviour and quickly broadened the market for mobile games, as almost every smartphone owner started to download mobile apps.</p>

<h2 style="font-family:Lucida Bright;color:#32CD32">Computer Games</h2>
<center><img src="D:\images\im\q2.jpg" alt="video games" width=70%></center>
<p style="font-family:Lucida Bright;font-size:20px">PC games, also known as computer games or personal computer games, are video games played on a personal computer rather than a dedicated video game console or arcade machine. Their defining characteristics include a more diverse and user determined gaming hardware and software, and a generally greater capacity in input, processing, and video output.<br>Home computer games became popular following the video game crash of 1983 leading to the era of the "bedroom coder". In the 1990s, PC games lost mass-market traction to console games before enjoying a resurgence in the mid-2000s through digital distribution.</p>
<p style="font-family:Lucida Bright;font-size:20px">Although there are other earlier examples of computer games, most consider the first true computer game or digital game to be "Spacewar!". This game was first played and programmed by Steve Russell and first released in February 1962. The game ran on the DEC PDP-1 computer, and consisted of two spaceships that maneuvered around a star that pulled at the ships with its gravity. The objective of the game was to avoid colliding with the star while trying to shoot the other ship with missiles.
The player controlled the game using control switches or a control box. They had the ability to rotate the ship clockwise or counterclockwise, provide the ship with thrust, fire missiles, and go into hyperspace. </p>

<h2 style="font-family:Lucida Bright;color:#FF007F"> Play Station</h2>
<center><img src="D:\images\im\w2.jpg" alt="video games" width=70%></center>
<p style="font-family:Lucida Bright;font-size:20px">PlayStation  is a gaming brand that consists of four home video game consoles, as well as a media center, an online service, a line of controllers, two handhelds and a phone, as well as multiple magazines. It is created and owned by Sony Interactive Entertainment since December 3, 1994, with the launch of the original PlayStation in Japan.The original PlayStation, released in Japan on December 3, 1994, was the first of the ubiquitous PlayStation series of console and hand-held game devices. It has included successor consoles and upgrades including the Net Yaroze (a special black PlayStation with tools and instructions to program PlayStation games and applications), "PS one" (a smaller version of the original) and the PocketStation (a handheld which enhances PlayStation games and also acts as a memory card). It was part of the fifth generation of video game consoles competing against the Sega Saturn and the Nintendo 64. By December 2003, the PlayStation and PS one had shipped a combined total of 102.49 million units, eventually becoming the first video game console to sell 120 million units</p>
<p style="font-family:Lucida Bright;font-size:20px"><strong>PS one:</strong>PS one Released on July 7, 2000,concurrently with its successor the PlayStation 2, the PS one was a considerably smaller, redesigned version of the original PlayStation video game console. The PS one went on to outsell all other consoles, including its successor, throughout the remainder of the year. It featured two main changes from its predecessor, the first being a cosmetic change to the console and the second being the home menu's Graphical User Interface; a variation of the GUI previously used only on PAL consoles up to that point.<br>
<strong>PlayStation 2,Original PlayStation 2 console (left) and slimline PlayStation 2 console with 8 MB Memory Card and DualShock 2 controller (right): </strong> PlayStation 2 Released in 2000, 15 months after the Dreamcast and a year before its other competitors, the Xbox and the Nintendo GameCube, the PlayStation 2 is part of the sixth generation of video game consoles, and is backwards-compatible with most original PlayStation games. Like its predecessor, it has received a slimmer redesign. It is the most successful home console in the world,having sold over 155 million units as of December 28, 2012.On November 29, 2005, the PS2 became the fastest game console to reach 100 million units shipped, accomplishing the feat within 5 years and 9 months from its launch. This achievement occurred faster than its predecessor, the PlayStation, which took "9 years and 6 months since launch" to reach the same figure.PlayStation 2 shipments in Japan ended on December 28, 2012.The Guardian reported on January 4, 2013 that PS2 production had ended worldwide, but studies showed that many people all around the world still own one even if it is no longer in use. PlayStation 2 has been ranked as the best selling console of all time as of 2015.<br>

<strong>PlayStation 3 ,Original (left) and slim (right) PlayStation 3 consoles with the DualShock 3 controller:</strong> PlayStation 3
Released on November 17, 2006 in North America, the PlayStation 3 is a seventh generation game console from Sony. It competes with the Microsoft Xbox 360 and the Nintendo Wii. The PS3 is the first console in the series to introduce the use of motion-sensing technology through its Sixaxis wireless controller. The console also incorporates a Blu-ray Disc player and features high-definition resolution. The PS3 was originally offered with either a 20 GB or 60 GB hard drive, but over the years its capacity increased in increments available up to 500 GB. The PlayStation 3 has sold over 80 million consoles worldwide as of November 2013.<br>

<strong>PlayStation 4 The PlayStation 4 with the DualShock 4 controller: </strong>PlayStation 4
The PlayStation 4 (PS4) is the latest video game console from Sony Computer Entertainment announced at a press conference on February 20, 2013. In the meeting, Sony revealed some hardware specifications of the new console. The eighth-generation system, launched in the fourth quarter of 2013, introduced the x86 architecture to the PlayStation series. According to lead system architect, Mark Cerny, development on the PlayStation 4 began as early as 2008. PlayStation Europe CEO Jim Ryan emphasized in 2011 that Sony wanted to avoid launching the next-generation console behind the competition.<br>

PlayStation 4 Pro or PS4 Pro for short (originally announced under the codename Neo) was unveiled on September 7, 2016. Its model number is CUH-7000. It is an updated version of the PlayStation 4 with improved hardware, including an upgraded GPU with 4.2 teraflops of processing power, and higher CPU clock. It is designed primarily to enable selected games to be playable at 4K resolution, and improved quality for PlayStation VR. All games are backwards and forward compatible between PS4 and PS4 Pro, but games with optimizations will have improved graphics performance on PS4 Pro. Although capable of streaming 4K video from online sources, PS4 Pro does not support Ultra HD Blu-ray. Additionally the PS4 Pro is the only PS4 model which can remote play at 1080p. The other models are limited to 720p.<br>
<strong>A PlayStation 5 has been confirmed but no release date has been revealed yet </strong></p>
